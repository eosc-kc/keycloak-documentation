=== Localization name support

In the login page users can see SAML and OIDC Identity Provider name based on the selected locale ( for Internationalization Enabled realm).
If localized Identity Provider name exists, this is displayed. Otherwise general Identity Provider name( or alias if general name does not exist) is displayed.

For SAML and OIDC Identity Provider name a separate fieldset with a table exists.
In this table user can add name for all supported locale by deployed Keycloak version.
